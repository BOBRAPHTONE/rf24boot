     * Detect vusb dongle bootloader and boot it 
     * More sane debugging output with --trace
     * Make use of new 'bulk' transfer mode

bootloader:     
     * Implement DEADTIME option
     * Use new 'bulk' transfer mode
     * No more continuity counter, it is handled in hardware now
     * New 'dummy' partition in for benchmarking

programming dongle: 
     * New hardware design with 16M crystal FTW!
     * Ultra-cheap 5x5 cm single-sided design
     * Implemented hardware packet buffering and async operation

     * Refactor rf24tool code and ditch all warnings
     * Code cleanup (still ugly in places, but readable at least)
     * Implement support for multiple adaptors. 
     * Huge performance improvements
     * Stability improvements with far nodes
     * Brand new test suite 
     * Spectrum inspection and plotting 

bootloader: 
     * Do not screw up when several packets are stuck in RX FIFO at once 
     * Minor performance and size improvements
