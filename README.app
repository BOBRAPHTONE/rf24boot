Userspace utilities
-------------------

The userspace consists of only one utility (rf24tool) that is used to upload 
your code to the target device. 
Navigate to rf24tool directory and run 
 make  
 sudo make install
Provided that you have libusb-dev installed, you'll get your app in the system. 
You can now plug in your adaptor and start using it. 

rf24tool --help provides a rough help that will let you get started.
